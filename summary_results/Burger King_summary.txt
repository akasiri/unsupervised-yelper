For a fast food chain, cheap and Sometimes semi fast food, this particular BK isn't too shabby. The food is Burger King quality. I love this burger king location it's not far from my house and the quality of food is sort of hit or miss but it's still good for what it is and the customer service is pretty good each time I come here. Food is good for fast food, clean on the inside but restroom is dirty.
