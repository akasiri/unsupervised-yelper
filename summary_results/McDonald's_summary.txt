Very friendly staff and decent food. Nicest mcdonalds i have ever been in,  great seating, good service, felt more like a nice coffee shop than a fast food restaurant. Service and quality of food are definitely not worth the wait in line. Not a typical McDonald's, really clean, unusually friendly staff and I got my food in under 45 seconds.
